How to use the app

The app is pretty easy to use

After launching the app you land on the home page where you can see two things

1) A text field where you need to enter the task you want to revise.
2) A date picker from which you can select the date on which you completed the task you mentioned in the above text field.

After filling all the information click on PLAN MY REVISION button which will automatically plan your revision schedule.

Below you will see three buttons named Notify First, Notify Second and Notify Third click on them one by one to add your schedule to your calendar.
